/**
 * 1. Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
 * 2. Make all fields final and private.
 * 3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. 
 * 		A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
 * 4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
 * 			Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
 * 			Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects 
 * 			passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. 
 * 			Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the 
 * 			originals in your methods.
